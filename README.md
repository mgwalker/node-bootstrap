# node-bootstrap

## Installation

Might as well install this one globally if you want to use it.  Or install
it locally if you'd like, but that seems silly.

```bash
npm install -g @mgwalker/node-bootstrap
```

## Usage

***NOTE:***  If you've enabled 2-factor authentication on your GitHub account,
you will need to create a personal access token, available at [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).  The
token for npm-bootstrap only needs the `public_repo` scope.

From the directory where you want to create your new module, run:

```bash
node-bootstrap
```

Then follow the prompts!
